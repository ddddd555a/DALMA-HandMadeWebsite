# DALMA-HandMadeWebsite

The theme I chose for the handmade website is Buddhism. Buddhism is a religion that gave me great lessons while I was in army. I learned how to look every objects and human being as a process that has cause and effect. No other emotions were interupting me while I tried to maintain the eyes of 'truth'.

Dharma was a semi-legendary Buddhist monk who lived during the 5th or 6th century. And the name has a meaning of the eternal and inherent nature of reality, regarded in Hinduism as a cosmic law underlying right behavior and social order.

A Dharma talk (Sanskrit) is a public discourse on Buddhism by a Buddhist teacher.

Here in the website, I introdue three quotes that teaches you one of the greatest lessons in Buddhism.

Horizontal scrolling website is a form that contains the quotes. In this website, I used inner wrapper and outer wrapper. inner wrapper in a screen that is actaully rotated -90 degrees. And outer wrapper exists to activate the horizontal screen to vertical scroll.

In the first page of the website, there is the drawing of dharma that can be seen as demonic figure. Most of the paintings of dharma leaves strong impression with their eyes wide open and beard. It is because there is an anecdote that he cut off his eyelids to prevent sleeping while training. Not only temples, but also Buddhists' homes and shops often hang one or two Dharma-do. It is said that if you hang it at home, you will receive good energy.
